# "Introduction to YOLO Model for Object Detection"

This file serves as an introduction to the YOLOV7 (You Only Look Once) model, a state-of-the-art approach to object detection in computer vision. YOLO revolutionized object detection by reframing it as a single regression problem, directly mapping image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. This introduction provides python code to train the YOLOV7 model on a given annotated image dataset and test the train model on a bunch of given unseen test images, further downloading the best trained model to the local system.
